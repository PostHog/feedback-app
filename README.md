# Feedback App

Gather feedback from your users with this app.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have enabled `opt_in_site_apps: true` in your posthog-js config init.
2. Install the app from the PostHog App Repository
3. Customise the text, and enable the plugin
4. Either select "Show feedback button on the page" or add a button with a corresponding data attribute e.g. `data-attr='posthog-feedback-button'` which when clicked will open the feedback widget 
4. Each feedback from your users is now captured as a custom `Feedback Sent` event
5. You can now use this event to trigger PostHog actions, or create a funnel to see how many users are giving feedback.
